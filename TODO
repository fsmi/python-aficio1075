Accounts:
- Find a way to _modify_ an account. (i.e. trace the utility responsible for
  this stuff.) We currently have to delete+add an account to modify it, which
  resets the counters.

- command-line tool to create, delete, disable and list accounts
- cron tool to create print accounts for snack-account people, disable inactive
  and altguru accounts.
- Replace manual XML string building with XML object-composition. Use
  ElementTree instead of DOM.
