* run as regular system daemon
* package as debian package
* Provide readme in English
* tray-applet which get's notified of finished scan jobs? (Can we detect which
  user created the job?)
* Determine format of the binary files in <ftp-root>/Address/ and
  <ftp-root>/Version/, as everything else appears to be optional (and the
  binary files are regularly downloaded by the printer)
