* Rewrite everything in python
* Use fk's mac_address.py module to determine the printer's MAC address.
* delete processed scan jobs
* run as regular system daemon, with proper logging to syslog, etc.
* package as debian package
* make conversion modular (currently there's 'plain' (convert to single PDF)
  and 'protokoll' (convert to a bunch of PDFs and use a certain heuristic to
  determine where to split))
* tray-applet which get's notified of finished scan jobs? (Can we detect which
